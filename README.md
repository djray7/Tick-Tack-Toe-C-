# Overview

In this software I hope to provide a simple, fun experience for the user. A game everyone grew up playing but now in digital form. 

The program has one class to demonstate how to use classes in C++. The class handles the different winning options. The program shows the board, asking the user for their input, as to what space they would like to choose as their move. after each move made by the user, it checks to see if one of the conditions that provides a "win" has been chosen. If so, it will stop the code with a caption syaing who won("o" or "x").

The biggest purpose of this code was to practise using C++. This game is something that isn't so complicated that it takes forever, but also provides enough difficulty to learn the basics of C++.

# Development Environment
I used Replit to write the code as for some reason it would not work on my vscode. I had attempted many different download combinations but couldn't get it to work. 

I used C++, and didn't use any libraries.

# Future Work

* I'll need to figure out how to use C++ in VScode
* How to utlize the for loops
* Restart option for the end of the game
